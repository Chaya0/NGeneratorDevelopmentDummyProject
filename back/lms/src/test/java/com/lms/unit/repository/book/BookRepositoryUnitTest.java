/**
* Since JPA repositories are typically tested via integration tests, there is often less need for unit tests
* for the repository itself. However, if your repository contains custom queries, you may write unit tests
* to verify logic around those queries. Still, most of the interaction with the database is tested using
* integration tests, as JPA repositories delegate most of their functionality to Spring Data JPA.
